project: git_commit

it is an application that allows us to search for any github user and acces their profile.
application that lists the commits of React using the Github API. 
view the repositorisies and more information by clicking on "show more"
you just have to enter the name of the person then click on one of the buttons to show more information or to view profile or to view the repositorisies

we used react js, jS frontend frameworks, Bootstrap.
also 2 components: partials and users.

thank you.
